    -> @import and Partials
        - Sass keeps the CSS code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). One way to write DRY code 
         is to keep related code in separate files.
        - You can create small files with CSS snippets to include in other Sass files. 
        Examples of such files can be: reset file, variables, colors, fonts, font-sizes, etc. 

    ->Sass Importing Files:
        Just like CSS, Sass also supports the @import directive.
        The @import directive allows you to include the content of one file in another.
        The CSS @import directive has a major drawback due to performance issues; it creates an extra HTTP request each time you call it. However, the Sass @import directive includes the file in the CSS; so no extra HTTP call is required at runtime!
        Sass Import Syntax:
            @import filename;
    -> Tip: You do not need to specify a file extension, Sass automatically assumes that you mean a .sass or .scss file. You can also import CSS files. The @import directive imports the file and any variables or mixins defined in the imported file can then be used in the main file.
        You can import as many files as you need in the main file:
        Example
            @import "variables";
            @import "colors";
            @import "reset";

/***************************************************/
  -> Sass Partials: (when a file is declared as partial file like this _file name : we are teling
                    Sass complier not to touch it so it will only compile main.scss file like always)
        
                    note:always use _ underscore before file name
        
        By default, Sass transpiles all the .scss files directly. However, when you want to 
        import a file, you do not need the file to be transpiled directly.

        Sass has a mechanism for this: If you start the filename with an underscore, 
        Sass will not transpile it. Files named this way are called partials in Sass.
        So, a partial Sass file is named with a leading underscore:

        Sass Partial Syntax:
            _filename; (use .scss file extension)
        Example
        "_colors.scss": //is a file
                $myPink: #EE82EE;
                $myBlue: #4169E1;
                $myGreen: #8FBC8F;
        Now, if you import the partial file, omit the underscore. Sass understands that it
         should import the file "_colors.scss":
                like this : @import "colors";
