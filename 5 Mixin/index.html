    //mixin is important
    mixin :The @mixin directive lets you create CSS code that is to be reused throughout the website. 
         The @include directive is created to let you use (include) the mixin.
        ->Here we are group those properties together which might be reused like this:
                                            @mixin name {
                                                    property: value;
                                                    property: value;
                                                    ...
                                                    }
                                            to use it like this
                                            selector {
                                                    @include mixin-name;
                                                    }
      ->  A mixin can also include other mixins:
                @mixin special-text {
                    @include important-text;
                    @include link;
                    @include special-border;
                }
