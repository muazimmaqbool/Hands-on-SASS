    Tip: A tip on hyphens and underscore in Sass: Hyphens and underscores are considered to 
    be the same. This means that @mixin important-text { } and @mixin important_text { } 
    are considered as the same mixin!
    
    ->What is SASS:
        Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a
        CSS pre-processor can help. Sass lets you use features that do not exist in CSS, 
        like variables, nested rules, mixins, imports, inheritance, built-in functions,
        and other stuff.
    -> Sass is like Css with super powers
    ->Sass is a CSS pre-processor.
    ->Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time.


    ->Why SCSS is called SASS?
         SASS is an acronym for: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets, 
         which is a pre-processor scripting language that is either interpreted
         or compiled into a CSS file. Often called Sassy CSS, 
       ->SCSS is the main syntax for SASS, which is a build on top of the CSS syntax that already exists.

        <h1>Welcome to SASS</h1>
        <!-- changing its color in main.scss -->
        <!-- Important: To apply it we need to first install live sass compiler extension
            : after intallation you will see watch sass button in buttom and the moment you
            click on it , it creates two files - main.css and main.css.map
            -> it creates them because our browser won't understand what is SASS it only understands
            html and css so, what it does , it complies this SCSS file at runtime and stores it in
            main.css (you will see same code in main.css also) via main.css.map
            -it adds main.css properties to html file 
            ->Now we don't have to work with main.css we will work with scss file
        ->But first we have to link main.css to html file  in the head section of html file
